Licence

I don't really know who owns rights to this file or the appropriate license, so as far as I am concerned
and unless a knowledgeable someone enlightens me, you can do What The Fuck You Want To with these files.
If you need more details, see [the WTF Public License Version 2 as published by Sam Hocevar](http://wtfpl.net).
